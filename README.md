# Project Summary
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-powered business intelligence (BI) service that allows users to visualize data, build dashboards, perform ad-hoc analysis, and derive insights. This project develops a comprehensive dashboard in Amazon QuickSight to gain insights into sales by multiple attributes for a global energy company. This comprehensive dashboard gives an overview of the sum of sales by order date, industry, region and subregion.

## Resources
Kindly download the sales database (in csv format) used to build this dashboard in this Github repository. With an AWS account and Amazon Quicksight subscription, you can build the dashboard shown below. 

## Features

- The dashboard shows the line chart of the sum of sales from January 2020 to December 2023 (blue line trend). The total sales from January 2024 to February 2025 is forecasted by the machine learning model of Amazon Quicksight (orange line trend).

- The donut chart also shows the sum of sales by Industries - such as Finance, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Tech, Consumer products, Retail, Communications, Transportation, and Misc. Each industry has an allocated color code, with a total sales sum of 2,297,200.  

- Meanwhile, the Sales Key Performance Indicator card at the top right, shows the amount of sales for all these industries for the year 2023. It also shows that the percentage of revenue increase between the year 2023 and the previous year 2022 is 20.62%, with 2023 earning 733,947.02. 

- Below the Sales KPI, the month with highest sales is extrapolated from the dataset. Specifically, the month with the highest sales of 112,326.47 is November 2023.

- The forecasting model of Amazon Quicksight is estimated to be 32,592.68 for February 2025.
